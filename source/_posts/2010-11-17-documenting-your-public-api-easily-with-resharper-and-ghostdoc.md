title: Documenting your public API easily with ReSharper and GhostDoc

In my [previous post](/2010/11/finding-static-fields-in-solution-using-resharper-and-agent-smith-plug-in/) on how to find static fields in the entire solution using ReSharper and a free ReSharper plug-in, [Agent Smith](http://code.google.com/p/agentsmithplugin/), I briefly mentioned that the described trick can be used to aid documenting the public API. Some people have asked me to elaborate, so here goes:

<!-- more -->

Typically, documented API should cover all public implementations, classes and interfaces. Visual Studio provides a mechanism called *[XML Comments](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc302121.aspx)*, which allows you to decorate your classes, methods, fields and properties with XML, and later generate documentation from those comments. A free add-in for Visual Studio called [GhostDoc](http://submain.com/products/ghostdoc.aspx) can assist documenting the API &ndash; by pressing a shortcut key (default is Ctrl-Shift-D) on any part of the class (i.e. methods, properties, etc.) it will generate a stub XML comment.

{% blockquote %}
For best results, default comments generated by GhostDog should almost always be replaced with a proper description.
{% asset_img image1.png %}
{% endblockquote %}

Depending on your preferences, you may not want to document any internal implementation. For this example, we will find all public members (methods, fields, etc.), except in `internal` classes.

After installing Agent Smith plug-in and GhostDoc (and optionally disabling Agent Smith's built-in naming conventions, which might conflict with those of ReSharper), go to **ReSharper Options &ndash; C# &ndash; Formatting style &ndash; Agent Smith code style settings**, and remove all existing rules:
{% asset_img image2.png %}

Now press **Add** on the left hand side, and select *Public* under Visibility:
{% asset_img image3.png %}

This will create a rule called **Public Declaration**, and will be applied to any member (method, property, field, etc.) having `public` visibility.

On the right hand side, under *Except*, press **Add** and add the following:
{% asset_img image4.png %}

This will add the exception on internal classes.

The steps above will add a suggestion *Public declaration should have XML comment.* to all matching members across the solution. In order to find all of them, use either the Code Issues Inspector, or turn Agent Smith's *Members must have XML comment* suggestion in Inspection Severity to *Show as error*, and navigate the errors using ReSharper shortcut keys. Both methods are further detailed in my [previous post](/2010/11/finding-static-fields-in-solution-using-resharper-and-agent-smith-plug-in/).

Press Ctrl-Shift-D (or whatever is bound to GhostDoc's **Document This** command) on each matching member, and give a proper description, replacing the default generated comment. Please view the [XML Documentation Comments guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b2s063f7.aspx) on MSDN for best practices.

Happy documenting!
