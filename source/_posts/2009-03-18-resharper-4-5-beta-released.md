JetBrains just <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/beta.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that ReSharper 4.5 has reached Beta status, and now available to <a href="http://download.jetbrains.com/resharper/ReSharperSetup.4.5.1208.6.msi" target="_blank">download</a>.

Here are some of my first impressions:

The installation was a snap &ndash; it asked to remove the previous version (4.1), and installed the new version instead, while keeping the previous settings.
  * There is a noticeable improvement in the Visual Studio 2008 responsiveness after startup, Start Page appears to be frozen much less than before.
  * Memory usage has dramatically improved! **devenv.exe** is no longer the hungriest process on my system, Firefox has regained its rightful place at the top of the Task Manager:

  * The **Options** dialog contains a new page for **Naming Style** settings, allowing much more control in customizing the naming conventions:

  * Finally, there is now a solution-wide analysis of unused public/protected methods, as well as visibility (works only when solution-wide analysis is on):

That's it for now. The beta seems stable and fast! Another quality product from the wizards at JetBrains. Can't wait for the final version!
