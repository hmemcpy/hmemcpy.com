Sometime ago my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/omervk" target="_blank">@omervk</a> and myself created <a href="http://plaintextoffenders.com/" target="_blank">Plain Text Offenders</a> &ndash; a wall of shame for websites that store and email your own password to you in plaintext. I didn't expect this kind of explosion &ndash; hundreds of submissions already posted and dozens of new ones arriving every day!

<!-- more -->

I have just learned that <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a> have contacted us about <a href="http://plaintextoffenders.com/post/6032496321/smashingmagazine-com-got-this-shortly-after" target="_blank">the post</a> on the wall of shame, saying that they took care of the issue, and no longer email plaintext passwords! Of course, we happily obliged by <a href="http://plaintextoffenders.com/post/6139194696/answering-the-call" target="_blank">amending the original post</a>.

**Way to go, Smashing Magazine!** We hope that more and more sites will take notice, and then take steps to make the Internet a better and safer place for all of us.
