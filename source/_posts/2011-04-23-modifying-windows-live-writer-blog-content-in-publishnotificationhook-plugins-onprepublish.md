title: Modifying Windows Live Writer blog content in PublishNotificationHook plugins' OnPrePublish

I'm writing a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff747355.aspx" target="_blank">PublishNotificationHook</a> plugin for Windows Live Writer (don't worry, I will soon reveal what it is), and I noticed that there doesn't seem to be a way to control the contents (text or HTML) of the blog post in this type of plugin.

<!-- more -->

Further digging led me to understand that there used to be a method modify the contents via Reflection, as described by <a href="http://scottisafooldev.wordpress.com" target="_blank">ScottIsAFool</a>, Live Writer MVP and author of many great plugins, using his <a href="http://scottisafooldev.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/new-writer-plugins-using-the-new-sdk/" target="_blank">WriterUtils</a>, however this doesn't seem to work anymore with the latest version of Live Writer 2011.

I had discovered that on a Japanese blog called <a href="http://blog.sharplab.net/" target="_blank">SharpLab</a>, someone had posted <a href="http://blog.sharplab.net/computer/cprograming/windowslivewriter/433/" target="_blank">a way</a> to excavate an internal BlogManager object, which is used by Live Writer to edit the actual blog posts. The code needed a slight modification, but with the result I was able to modify the contents of my blog post!

I extracted this into an extension method, use this at your own risk!

```csharp
// based on an old blog post in Japanese: http://blog.sharplab.net/computer/cprograming/windowslivewriter/433/
// The field was moved to a base type in the latest version of Live Writer

using System.Reflection;
using WindowsLive.Writer.Api;
using WindowsLive.Writer.Extensibility.BlogClient;
using WindowsLive.Writer.PostEditor;

namespace WindowsLiveWriterPlugin.Extensions
{
    public static class PublishingContextExtensions
    {
        public static void ReplaceText(this IPublishingContext publishingContext, string newText)
        {
            FieldInfo fieldInfo = publishingContext.GetType().BaseType.GetField("_editingContext", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
            BlogPostEditingManager manager = (BlogPostEditingManager)fieldInfo.GetValue(publishingContext);
            BlogPost blogPost = (BlogPost)publishingContext.PostInfo;

            blogPost.Contents = newText;

            manager.EditPost(new BlogPostEditingContext(manager.BlogId, blogPost));
        }
    }
}
```
