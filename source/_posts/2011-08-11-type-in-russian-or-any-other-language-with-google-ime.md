title: Type in Russian (or any other language) with Google IME

I speak Russian, but I never bothered to learn how to properly type it on the keyboard. Every time I needed to search or write something, I would use a transliteration service, such as <a href="http://www.translit.ru" target="_blank">translit.ru</a>, then copy the translated text to clipboard and paste it to the target window (such as a Skype chat session).

**Update 23/01/2019:** It seems that Google had [discontinued](https://support.google.com/chrome/forum/AAAAP1KN0B0pIRUZE4f68I/) the IME tools for Windows (in favor of a Chrome extension), so it's no longer available for download. Fortunately, there's a similar functionality now built into Windows 10 - by installing the **Russian Mnemonic** keyboard! 

Here's how to install:
 1. Go to **Language Settings** in the control panel
 2. If you haven't already, press **Add a language** and select **Russian**
 3. Go to **Options** of the Russian language, and under **Keyboards**, press **Add a keyboard**
 4. Select **Russian - Mnemonic (ЯШЕРТЫ)** (you can remove the "regular" Russian keyboard)

It uses slightly different mnemonics than Google IME, but it works well (and I still don't have to learn how to properly type on a Cyrillic layout!)

*Original post below:*

Here is how it works: after installing Google IME <a href="http://www.google.com/ime/transliteration/" target="_blank">in your language</a>, you will have that language added in your languages bar. Then, when you switch to that language using Alt-Shift, you then can type in English letters, and Google IME will automatically convert it to the target language (even suggesting the correct spelling if you made a mistake!).

Suppose I want to type *который час* (*what time is it?*). I switch to the Russian language, then type the word *kotoryj*:
{% asset_img image2.png %}

Upon pressing space, the first option will be selected, and _kotoryj_ will be replaced with _который_. This works everywhere, from input fields to Word documents! When I'm done, I switch back to English using Alt-Shift.

<img style="float: right; padding: 5px;" src="{% asset_path image3.png %}" />For convenience, there's also a toolbar that appears when the IME language is selected. If you don't know how to transliterate a particular character, there's a helpful character picker which you can use.

Horosho!
