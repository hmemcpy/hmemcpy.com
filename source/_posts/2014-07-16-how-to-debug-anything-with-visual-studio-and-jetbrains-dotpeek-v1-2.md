Sometimes, we wish we could just step into some 3<sup>rd</sup> party library, to figure out how it works, but we either don't have the source code, or otherwise just can't. Fortunately, this is made possible by **dotPeek v1.2** that was [just released](http://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2014/07/16/dotpeek-1-2-is-released/), which can act as a symbol server for decompiled assemblies!

So let's suppose we want to put a breakpoint inside `Console.WriteLine` (or any other method in any other assembly). Here's what we need to do:

  * Open dotPeek, add the required assemblies to the Assembly Explorer, and press the **Start Symbol Server** button.

You can configure the port and the symbol generation settings in **Tools - Options**. The default address is `http://localhost:33417/`.

  * In Visual Studio, go to **Tools - Options**, then navigate to **Debugging - Symbols**. Add the location of the dotPeek symbol server.

In addition, make sure that **Just My Code** (in **General**) is unchecked, and press OK. Some symbols will be loaded, this might take a few moments.

  * Next, we need to set a breakpoint _inside_ the method which we're interested in. This can be done with a little-known Visual Studio trick, allowing you to create a breakpoint at any function. Go to **Debug - New Breakpoint - Break at Function**, and in the dialog enter the fully qualified method name, e.g. `System.Console.WriteLine`.

After pressing OK, you'll get a message saying *IntelliSense could not find the specified location. Do you still want to set the breakpoint?*. It's fine - press Yes.

  * Finally, start your application with the debugger (F5) and you will stop at the breakpoint! You can use all familiar debugging options, such as stepping over/into, watch, autos and the datatip.

Happy Debugging!
