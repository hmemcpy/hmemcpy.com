In the worst security breach in [Gawker Media](http://gawker.com/) history, a 500mb file containing Gawker's source code, and employee passwords was [released to the internet](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/gawker-hacked/), compromising email addresses and passwords of hundreds of thousands of users.

<!-- more -->

Studies show that [over 30% of sites](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/rockyou_hacker_30_of_sites_store_plain_text_passwords.php) store our passwords in plain-text in their database.

We had enough! Today, Omer van Kloeten (<a href="http://twitter.com/omervk" target="_blank">@omervk</a>) and myself are announcing [Plain Text Offenders](http://plaintextoffenders.com) &ndash; a registry of *text offenders* &ndash; sites which store and/or send our own passwords to us via email in clear text!

> We're tired of websites abusing our trust and storing our passwords in plain text, exposing us to danger. **Here we put these websites to shame.**

So please go ahead &ndash; report offending sites at <http://plaintextoffenders.com>!
